# Travelers

A terminal based game written mainly in PHP and C.

## PHP

As I said everything is written in PHP except a few things (see below).
### C
The on thing written in C is the function readKey because with PHP I had performance issues
on Windows because there isn't really a way to read one single input like there is on Linux/Macos.

## Operating System

Right now the game is Windows only but in future it might also be on Linux/Mac.

## Language

Right now the game is in German but in the future it is likely that the game will also be avaiable in English.
